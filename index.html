            The is the flag of Bangladesh, 
            often referred to as the "Red-Green" or 
            "Bengali" flag, features a simple yet 
            meaningful design. It consists of a deep 
            green background with a large red circle 
            positioned slightly toward the hoist side. 
            The green background represents the lush green
            landscape of Bangladesh, while the red circle
            symbolizes the bloodshed and sacrifice made 
            by those who fought for the nation's 
            independence. This flag was officially adopted 
            on January 17, 1972, after Bangladesh gained 
            independence from Pakistan. It embodies 
            the country's history, struggles, and aspirations 
            for a peaceful and prosperous future.
